# herbly-tea-companion
This app helps users make a great cup of loose-leaf tea

## Architecture
This app is meant to run on AWS infrastructure
- DynamoDB provides the initial tea database
- Java Spring Boot implements the core business logic
- React, Vue, or Angular will be used for front-end. This needs further investigation.
